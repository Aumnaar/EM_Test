This is test project for the Effective Mobile; 2d-game with platformer elements.
Basic tutorial implemented in the game. Also copy here: to move A and D, to jump W (triple jump allowed), to glide hold spacebar, to attack left mouse button.
Enemies can be killed by attack or touch, but in the last case they do damage to player.
